const rules = `The game is played in voice chat. One or more people (depending on the configuration) are randomly assigned the spy role.
Others are sent this round's location and a role to play at that location (to help with answering questions).
Players ask each other questions to find out who the spy is or - in case of the spy - find out what the location of the round is.
The person who was asked a question decides who they are asking next, however the person they were asked by may not be picked.
A person who was voted out is neither able to start a vote nor cast their vote anymore in case the game continues after the vote.

Votes with more than one spy in the game have to hit at least 50% of the votes to be successful (this also means the spies win when they are 50% of the players remaining).
Votes with only one spy in the game have to be unanimous to be successful!

If the spy guesses the location correctly, they win! If they guess incorrectly, they lose (there is different behaviour configurable when playing with more than one spy).
If the players guess the correct spy, they win! If they guess the incorrect person, they either lose or the person they voted for is not able to play anymore (depending on the configuration).
If the timer runs out and the players haven't caught the spy, the spy wins!

You can use the following commands to interact with the game:
\`!vote @player\` in this chat to start a vote for a player. Everyone may vote except for the person that's being voted and players previously voted out.
\`!reveal\` in DMs with me to reveal yourself as the spy. You will then have to guess the location in this chat. The command won't work in this channel to not give clues as to whether you are actually the spy or not.
\`!timer\` to see the time remaining in this round (works both in DMs and in this channel).
\`!locations\` to list the possible locations (works both in DMs and in this channel).

Here are the locations: ${locations
  .map((location) => location.location)
