# YesBot - The famous bot that handles and serves Yes Theory Fam Discord server

This repository contains the code powering a Discord bot called YesBot
on [the Yes Theory Fam Server](https://discord.gg/yestheory).

Feel free to contribute, learn and ask questions if you have any! Most importantly: Have fun while doing so :)

## Quick note:

This bot is not intended to be run on servers with a vastly different channel and role structure than the Yes Theory Fam
Server. While possible, chances are it will take quite some effort to adapt the bot to a different server.
